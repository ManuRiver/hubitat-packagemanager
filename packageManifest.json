	"releaseNotes": "Added support for assigning tags to a package to make searching easier\nUnified the UI so that it works the same way whether you are searching for a package or browsing by tags.\nResults will show up to 5 tags associated with a package.\nAll packages are shown in the results, even ones you have installed. They will have a checkmark shown instead of a download icon.\nFixed bugs related to beta releases not updating properly.\nFixed a bug when a new optional driver was added to an existing package.\nTags and categories are now validated. So if one isn't in the supported list it will NOT show up.\nAdded a primary app option which allows a package author to automatically launch an app after installing a new package.\nAdded the ability to remove custom repositories.\nYou now receive a notification when a new repository is added so you can do a Match Up.",
